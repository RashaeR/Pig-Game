So how do you play Pig?

Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesn’t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.

If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.

Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.

How do you win?

The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.

Are there any rule or scoring variations?

Two-Dice Pig

This variant is the same as Pig, except two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total. If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends. If two 1s are rolled, the player’s entire score is lost and their turn ends.
